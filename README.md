Challenge #2 - All in One

Person Reviewing (Daniel Herrera): 
All of your endpoints are working properly but there are some bugs that need to be worked!

Here are the following suggestions I think you should implement
    In the hello world endpoint, add the name variable into the route!
    Fix the service logic to add num1 And num2 instead of adding num1 twice
    In the ReverseItAlpha, the string passed in should have a .trim to get rid of any loose whitespaces

I like how you returned your guess it endpoint as a JSON object.
Make sure you create a step by step instruction for creating Hello World endpoint and using the endpoint through swagger!
